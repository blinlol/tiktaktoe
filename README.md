Client-server tic-tac-toe using the command line interface.

Starting the game:
1) Starting the server: ``go run server/main.go``
2) We launch clients in two terminals: ``go run client/main.go``
3) The game is created automatically and two client players are connected to it.If one player wins or there is a draw, then the server and clients exit.

This project is all about trying to write go code, trying grpc and protobuf protocols.So, all goals of this project have been achieved!

The draft version and its further fate are still unknown...
